Starting March 2025 Google will change the pricing scheme from the US$200 per month credit to 10,000 free requests.
This means with the standard update interval costs will incur if you have more than 1 sensor configured.
You can find more information on the pricing changes [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/faq#pricing-sheet).
