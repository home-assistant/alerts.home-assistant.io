The newest firmware update for Somfy TaHoma, released on January 28, 2025, disrupts the local API functionality. Unfortunately, there is no available workaround, and a gateway update from Somfy will likely be necessary. Downgrading the firmware is not an option.

If you haven't installed the latest update yet, it's recommended to disable automatic updates in the Somfy app. To do this, go to "Configuration of the Installation -> TaHoma Hub -> Box Update -> Automatic Updates."
