title: Docker 20.10 not compatible with Supervised installations

On December 9, 2020 Docker released version 20.10. This version is currently not compatible with the Supervisor that is running on a Supervised installation. If you are running our Home Assistant Operating System or Home Assistant Core directly in Docker, this alert does **not** apply to you.

There are 2 parts to this issue. The first is the removal of filtering of images over the API, this results in images not being recognized by the Supervisor correctly.

The second issue is changes in how the systemd service for Docker works, which results in the service `hassio-supervisor` not being able to start on system boot.

## Workaround

The only known workaround at this point is downgrading Docker to the previous version. The example below is for Debian 10. If that is not your OS, check the documentation for your OS's package manager on how to perform the downgrade.

```bash
apt install docker-ce=5:19.03.14~3-0~debian-buster
apt install docker-ce-cli=5:19.03.14~3-0~debian-buster
apt install containerd.io=1.3.9-1
```

When the downgrade is complete, do a system reboot. Once it has fully started you need to run `ha supervisor repair` and `ha supervisor restart` to fix problems with add-ons.


## Update December 15, 2020

Today docker has released version 20.10.1. This version fixes the issues with systemd, and startup of the `hassio-supervisor` service.

We have published version 2020.12.7 of our Supervisor to the beta channel. This version fixes the remaining filtering issue.

If you want to help test this fix you can do that by joining the beta channel in the UI on the "System" tab in the Supervisor panel, or with CLI:

```bash
ha supervisor options --channel beta
ha supervisor reload
ha supervisor update
```

When you have version 2020.12.7 of the Supervisor running you can update Docker to 20.10.1.
