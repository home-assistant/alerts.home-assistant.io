Updating your Somfy TaHoma bridge 2020.3.4-12 will cause the Tahoma integration for Home Assistant to no longer work.

## Workaround
The Tahoma integration for Home Assistant is in the process of being completely rewritten and modernized. An initial beta version has been [released as a custom integration](https://github.com/imicknl/ha-tahoma) in order to gather feedback and bug reports. After the testing period concludes the changes will be integrated back into Home Assistant.
