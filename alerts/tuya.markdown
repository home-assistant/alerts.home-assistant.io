Currently you might experience a delay in updating, or missing state updates
when using the Tuya integration.

This issue is not a bug with Home Assistant, but a problem with the Tuya
Cloud API. The issue has been confirmed by Tuya and they are working on
a solution.

They expect everything to function normally again in the upcoming week.
