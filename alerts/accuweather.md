On September 9, 2025, AccuWeather unveiled a new version of its API. The existing API keys have expired and the new API keys are not compatible with the integration. Furthermore, AccuWeather currently does not offer a free plan for access to its API; only paid plans are available. You can check details [here](https://developer.accuweather.com/pricing).
