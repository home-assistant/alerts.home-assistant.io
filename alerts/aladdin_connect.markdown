## Summary

Home Assistant 2022.6 and earlier used an old way of interacting with Aladdin products which is no longer supported.

Home Assistant 2022.7 implements a modern way. Users of Aladdin products should update as soon as possible to be able to continue using their Aladdin products uninterrupted.
