After the MQTT server of Nello has been unreachable for several weeks now, the [homepage](https://www.nello.io/) and the [API](https://public-api.nello.io/v1/) are also unreachable since noon today (12:08:33 CET).

SCLAK, which has operated Nello's infrastructure until now, filed for bankruptcy in October 2020 and has not responded to requests for weeks.
