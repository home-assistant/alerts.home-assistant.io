Updating your Apple TV to tvOS 13 will cause the Apple TV media player integration for Home Assistant to no longer work.

The current version of the integration relies on the legacy DAAP-protocol which is being phased out in tvOS 13 in favor of the MediaRemoteTV protocol (MRP) going forward. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/postlund/pyatv/issues/180) which will require an update to the pyatv python library.

If you wish to continue using the Apple TV media player integration in Home Assistant, it's recommended to hold off on installing tvOS 13 at this time. On your Apple TV device, navigate to Settings > System > Software Updates and turn off auto updates.

## Update
Thanks to Pierre St√•hl, the Apple TV integration for Home Assistant is in the process of being completely rewritten and modernized. An initial beta version has been [released as a custom integration](https://github.com/postlund/hass-atv-beta) in order to gather feedback and bug reports. After the testing period concludes the changes will be integrated back into Home Assistant.
