The OpenZWave integration is deprecated. We recommend using the [Z-Wave JS integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js).

The OpenZWave integration will no longer receive any updates. The technical dependencies may render this integration unusable in the future at which time it will be removed.
