Firefox 88 and higher introduced an issue with strict privacy checking in combination with add-ons that are using our ingress feature. This is causing users to see an error "401 unauthorized" when opening such panels. The issue is being tracked by Mozilla here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1725996

## Workaround

Disable strict privacy checking for the Home Assistant app.
