Ambee have changed their terms of service for their free API accounts. They now have a 15 day limit for new and existing users. 

Users will no longer be able to use the Ambee integration without a paid API account. See https://www.getambee.com/pricing for pricing details. 

The Climacell integration is a possible free alternative. https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/climacell/
