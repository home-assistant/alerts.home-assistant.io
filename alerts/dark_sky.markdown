Dark Sky has been [acquired by Apple](https://blog.darksky.net/dark-sky-has-a-new-home/) and is no longer allowing new registrations for their API. 

New users will no longer be able to obtain an API key which is a necessary requirement to configure the [Dark Sky integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather.darksky/) in Home Assistant. The Home Assistant website features [alternative weather integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#weather).

For existing users that have already obtained an API key, the Dark Sky API will continue to function until the end of ~~2021~~ 2022.

**Update** June 7, 2021: Support for the Dark Sky API service for existing customers will continue until the end of 2022.

Please see their blog post for more information: https://blog.darksky.net/.
