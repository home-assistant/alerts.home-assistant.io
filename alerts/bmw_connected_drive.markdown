BMW has shut down the old API (`Connected Drive app`) to force people to migrate to their new API (`My BMW app`).

Work is underway to migrate to the new API but this has not been finished yet 
(see [bimmerconnected/bimmer_connected#299](https://github.com/bimmerconnected/bimmer_connected/discussions/299)).
