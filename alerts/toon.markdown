The Toon integration is currently not able to authenticate with the Quby ToonAPI.

This causes the integration not to work, for both existing and new users of the integration.
Eneco Toon, Engie Electrabel Boxx and Viesgo users are all affected.

A fix addressing this issue is currently awaiting inclusion in Home Assistant.
