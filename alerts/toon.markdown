The Toon integration is currently not able to authenticate with the Qubby ToonAPI.

This causes the integration not to work, for both existing and new users of the integration.
User from Eneco Toon, Engie Electrabel Boxx and Viesgo are all affected.

A fix addressing this issue is currently awaiting inclusion in Home Assistant.
