Loop Energy are [shutting down their old infrastructure](https://email.loop.homes/action-required-how-to-claim-your-free-loop-upgrade-1).

Existing users integrations will stop working on 2020-11-13.

The loop energy integration is not compatible with the replacement infrastructure, and it does not look easy to make it so (no web access to data, no public API, mobile app access only).
