The Automatic connected car platform is
[shutting down operations on May 28, 2020](https://automatic.com/customerfaq) due to
adverse impacts upon their business by COVID-19.

Because this shutdown date will be one week after the 0.110.0 release of Home Assistant,
that release will still allow use of the integration up to May 28. After that date,
users will need to remove any configuration related to `automatic`. Full removal of the
integration's code will occur in the 0.111.0 release.
