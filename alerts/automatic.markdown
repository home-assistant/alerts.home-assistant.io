The Automatic connected car platform is
[shutting down operations on May 28, 2020](https://automatic.com/customerfaq) due to
adverse impacts upon their business by COVID-19.

Because this shutdown date coincides with the planned 0.110.0 release of Home Assistant,
the `automatic` integration will be removed in that release. Users should anticipate
removing any configuration related to `automatic` at that time
